# An-Application-to-track-the-product-price-in-amazon
We will be planning to buy a product from amazon, we will wait untill the price goes down a bit. Instead us checking everytime, we can use python to scrap the amazon website's cost of the product and once the price goes down to the desired value that we need, we will get a notification mail.
